Embedded system, mission and control code for Spacefrogs - Group 3

This is our whole code including rodos. The support libs are additionally required for a working wifi connection.
Bluetooth is configured with 921600 baudrate.

Unfortunately, we couldn't finish the mission.
As you saw in our presentation, the manual control worked fine, even the wire burning after we plugged in the external power!
Coding style for the mission part may not be pretty, but it was done under a lot of pressure and in quite a hurry.

Have fun looking at our code.
