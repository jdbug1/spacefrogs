CURRENT STATUS
==============

Thread Handling, Interrupts and Uart are very well tested on the ECU (Levitator).


LIMITATIONS
===========

This RODOS port will only work for LPC23xx and LPC24xx as it relies on the
Vectorised Interrupt Controller (VIC) of these devices.

When changing VIC_VectAddr and implementing a sporious interrupt handler
the code will work on the other ARM7 controllers from NXP as well.

For controller from other manufactors more work needs to be done.


AUTHORS
=======

- David Waleczek wrote the initial ARM7 port of RODOS
- Fabian Greif added amongst other things Interrupt handling, an extended Abort
  handler and an Interrupt driven UART implementation
