This is a tutorial to write gateways from the RODOS middleware
to different networks.

If you are a normal user who does not want to extende RODOS
then you do not need to read this.


Read First tutorial_middleware_distributed

Sender and receiver are examples of normal aplications.

gatewayexample :
	1. forwards messages to stdout (just print)
	2. read messages from stdoin (nowaiting) in the form of two integers
		the first represents a tocic id and the second a value
		this work only with subscribers to topics like
		Topic<long,   10>    counter1;
		the value may be only a long (4 bytes)

At the end of linkinterfaceexample.cc you can see how to define
which topics shall be forwarded to the network.

Try:
compile-linux demo_topics.cc linkinterfaceexample.cc
	tst
	type for example
		10 200
		20 200
		30 200

compile-linux demo_topics.cc linkinterfaceexample.cc receiver*
	tst
	type for example
		10 200
		20 200
		30 200
		40 200
		50 200
		10 100

compile-linux demo_topics.cc linkinterfaceexample.cc sender*
	try to modify the forwad lis at the end of networkexample.cc and retry

compile-linux demo_topics.cc linkinterfaceexample.cc sender* receiver*
